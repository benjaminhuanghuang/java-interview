## Java 8 Streams
```
    java.util.stream
```
 streams are wrappers around a data source, allowing us to operate with that data source and making bulk processing convenient and fast.
 
 A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never modifies the underlying data source.
